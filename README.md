### Programming Assignment Prompt
Problem 8. Develop system which will help a school in smoothly running its educational program. They need to keep track
of courses and their prerequisites, teachers/instructors, students and administrators. Courses may be offered in specific 
semesters by specific instructors. Students may register in courses without passing an allowed number of courses/credits but
they must complete prerequisites first. Instructors can post announcements, homeworks, exams, practice/lab material, lecture
notes, videos, etc. Students should submit their solutions for the homeworks/exams by the specified deadline. Instructors
can mark a submission and provide feedback. Students should be able to evaluate instructors for each course separately using a
questionnaire with scale from 1 to 10 and should be able to add written text. The evaluation by each student should be weighted 
based on his/her performance in the course. For example, lower weight should be assigned to an poor evaluation by a student whose
performance is poor in case some poorperforming students have good evaluation. Based on the evaluation, it is important to rank
instructors based on course level (year in the program) or based on the specific course if more than one section are offered in 
one semester.(4 students)
